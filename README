# This is my superb project
This project will be making a virtual vending machine that the user can interacct with. 
The vending machine will be stocked according to the user's file. They will be able 
to add items to their virtual cart, and then proceed to checkout with a payment 
where they will be given a receipt upon payment. 
I will be using the MIT liscence.
